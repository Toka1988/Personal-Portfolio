<p>Learning can be a pretty personal thing.</P>
  <p> different techniques tend to work for different people, and you may find that the strategies that have helped you understand one kind of topic may not be as effective for another.</p>
  <p> That's completely normal, so don't worry! There's a lot of contradictory advice out there, but there are also plenty of tried-and-true approaches supported by the kinds of organizations that would know best, such as university learning centers.</p>
  <p> Those techniques are definitely the best places to start, so we've done the research for you and collected all the best advice here.</p>
  <p> With a little persistence, you'll likely be able to improve your focus and absorb information more effectively.

  Figure out which study method works best for you.</p>
  <p> This varies from person to person, and you can take a quiz to find out if you wish. It's important to know, as how you study, learn, and take notes will all vary on this. There are four main learning styles. You don't have to choose one; you can mix it up.
  Visual: For this style, you learn mainly by looking at pictures, such as graphs, diagrams, and charts.
  Auditory: Learners who learn with this style learn the best when they hear the information and say it.
  Writing/Reading: Learners who use this method learn best when material is presented to them in a slides and handouts format.
  Kinesthetic: This is a more hands-on method. For example, for science, learners who use this method may want to try some science related experiments.
