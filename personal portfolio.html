<p>Learning can be a pretty personal thing, different techniques tend to work for different people, and you may find that the strategies that have helped you understand one kind of topic may not be as effective for another.[1] That's completely normal, so don't worry! There's a lot of contradictory advice out there, but there are also plenty of tried-and-true approaches supported by the kinds of organizations that would know best, such as university learning centers. Those techniques are definitely the best places to start, so we've done the research for you and collected all the best advice here. With a little persistence, you'll likely be able to improve your focus and absorb information more effectively.
